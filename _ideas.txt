SEAPUNK's ideas for this project:

Oh man, this project is a mess. That's really dawning on me now that
I'm digging through the project to improve it.

First off, let's quickly just clean everything out, and start from scratch.

---

Clean out:

1. What is the minimum for _running_ the code?

- src/ files, obviously. This is the C++ source for uWS.
- Node.js sources. Specifically, uws.js, package.json, and... addon.cpp? Not completely sure. I'll have to look in the Makefile.

Let's branch this. -> `cleanout`
